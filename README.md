# 📝Inspiration
A shark is a large, stealthy fish with many teeth. Generally depicted as a gray shark in full profile facing left, as a tiger, bull, or great white shark hunting in the water. Shown with a white underside and three gills, its pointed nose and teeth-lined mouth curving down to a sharp dorsal fin and long, pointed tail. So being a Shark lover I have been always curious about learning more about sharks but for this need to go to different places and search on different platforms. This makes me very frustrated. So we came up with the idea of Sharkpedia. A free Encyclopedia for Sharks

# 🦈Sharkpedia
Sharkpedia is a free online encyclopedia for Sharks. Where you can read more about sharks, Also able to see content regarding the same, and the admin can post more about the shark as well

# 💡What it does
The Sharkpedia is capable of doing a multitude of things such as:
- Read more about the shark
- Search the shark
- Write about the shark
- Read shark-themed articles and images It's shark time y'all!

# 💭How we build it
- For the frontend, we use React js, Vue js, Quasar UI 
- For the backend, we use app write

# 🪄Challenges we ran into
- it is the first time we work with app write and vue and the quasar. At first, it is very challenging for us to understand. But in the end, we will be able to do that.

# 💫Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Able to build our first web app with app write as a backend that really solved a real-world problem.

# 🖋What we learned
- We learned that sharks are really cool creatures, but also how to make use of app write as backend. Blahaj Never Gonna You Up, Never Gonna Let You Down:)

# 📝What's next for Sharkpedia
- Add a shark theme game
- Incorporate AR
- able to reach 100 users
